Welcome to my (newbie) dotfiles.
# What this is all about

The current tracked files are:
- terminator config: ~/.config/terminator/config (should be dropping terminator soon)
- vimrc: ~/.vimrc 
- aliases I use. Add source to current zsh or bash config
- tmux config: .tmux.conf
- .gitconfig
- ftplugins for python and  markdown (should add JS+html+css scala in the future)

 
# Where I got help from 

There were a few places that helped and are helping me.
 - Luke Smith's [channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC2eYFnH61tmytImy1mTYvhA) has helped me a lot with customizing my setup together with mapping shortcuts and guide navigation within vim. I've adapted his ideas into my language snippets, but I've tweaked a few things for my personal preferences. 
 - For vim stuff [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XA2WjJbmmoM) presentation has helped me a lot, even though I still think my setup kinda bloated.
 - After going to twitter and having a conversation with the amazing Julia Evans, one of her followers recommend me [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlR5gYd6um0) talk. It was eye opener and is what started it all.
 - There were a bunch of different vimrcs through out the *interwebs* that I've checked, and I couldn't possibly remember them all, sorry guys...
